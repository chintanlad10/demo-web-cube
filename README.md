## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **main.js** - Coordinates the application, handles events, and manages the animation loop
- **Cube.js** - Manages the overall cube state and move execution
- **Cubie.js** - Represents individual cube pieces with geometry and animation
- **Sticker.js** - Handles the colored faces and their positioning
- **Constants.js** - Defines configuration values and input mappings

## How It Works

### 3D Rendering
The cube consists of 26 individual pieces (cubies) positioned in a 3x3x3 grid, excluding the center piece. Each cubie can have 1-3 colored stickers depending on its position (corner, edge, or center piece).

### Animation System
Moves are queued and processed sequentially to ensure smooth animations. Each rotation is animated over multiple frames using delta-time calculations for frame-rate independence.

### Cube Solving
The WebAssembly solver analyzes the current cube state and returns an optimal solution using a custom CFOP implementation. The solver is compiled from C++ source code developed specifically for this project and available at [github.com/chintanlad10/demo-solver](https://github.com/chintanlad10/demo-solver). The solution is then animated move by move with timing and statistics tracking.

### State Management
The application maintains both visual positions (for smooth animations) and logical positions (for cube state) of each piece, ensuring the visual representation always matches the logical state.

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Chromium (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

Requires WebAssembly support and ES6 module compatibility.

## Development

This project demonstrates several advanced web development concepts:

- ES6 module system with clean dependency management
- WebAssembly integration for performance-critical algorithms
- 3D graphics programming with Three.js
- Complex event handling for multiple input methods
- Mathematical transformations for 3D rotations
- State management for real-time applications

## Solver

The cube solving algorithm is powered by a custom C++ implementation compiled to WebAssembly. The solver uses an optimized CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) method and is available as an open-source project at:

**üîó [demo-solver](https://github.com/chintanlad10/demo-solver)**

This custom solver provides fast and efficient cube solving with optimal move sequences.
